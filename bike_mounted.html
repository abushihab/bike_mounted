<div><h3>portable. But Powerful</h3></div>
<div>
<p>
A fire can start anywhere, at anytime. And in just 6 minutes, it can turn into an uncontrollable blaze. This makes it even more important for you to tackle the fire, before it's too late.<br>
Unfortunately tiny lanes, inaccessible roads and traffic jams all are a setback when it comes to rushing to the rescue, which means that by the tie the fire engine reaches the scene of the fire, it could very possibly already be too late.<br>
The need of the hour is a fire engine that can manoeuver any road, zip through traffic and reach the burning preises in minutes.<br>
Caesefire introduces a state-of-the-art extinguisher on wheels - The Mobile Firefighter. Powered by the world's most revolutionary firefighting technology: Watermist.
</p></div>
<div><h3>Watermist Technology and HOw it Works</h3></div>
<div><p>
Ceasefire's patented Waterist technology uses the world's oldest, most effective fire suppressant- water. Increasing itspower many times over.<br>
Here's how. Ceasefire extinguishers equiped with watermist break water down into a fine mist. This mist then thrown at the fire with a great kinetic force, covering a large surface area. As soon as the mist comes in contact with the fire, it instantly turns into steam. Enveloping the flames, cutting down the oxygen supply and reducing the temperature to below combustion levels. Ensuring that even the largest fire succumbs to Watermist technology. In minutes.

 <td>1. The air passes through a reducer which reduces the pressure to 7.5 bars. It then flows to the gun and the vessel.</td>
  <td>2. Specially constructed chambers and nozzles atomise the mixture to optimum size Watermist droplets (100-150)</td>
  <td>3. The aerodynamics of the gun  further accelerates the speed of the droplets.</td>
